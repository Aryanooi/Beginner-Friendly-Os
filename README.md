This project implements a minimal, educational operating system kernel designed for learning purposes. 
The system features a basic bootloader, kernel with VGA text mode support, and interactive applications including a calculator and text editor and games. 
Built using assembly and C, it demonstrates fundamental OS concepts like bootstrapping, memory management, input/output handling, and basic user interface implementation.
The kernel supports keyboard input, screen output, and provides a simple menu-driven interface for educational demonstration of operating system principles.
